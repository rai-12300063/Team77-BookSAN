   - Tests HTTP endpoints and responses
   - Requires database connection

4. **oopPatternsTest.js**
   - Tests object-oriented principles
   - Validates implementation of design patterns
   - Ensures architectural integrity

## Running Tests

To run all 48 passing tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test suites:

```bash
npm run test:simplified # Run the 48 reliable tests
npm run test:main       # Main functionality tests
npm run test:functional # API functional tests
npm run test:oop        # OOP and design patterns tests
npm run test:comprehensive # Run a comprehensive suite
```

For development with watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Coverage

These tests cover:

- **Authentication**: Registration, login, authorization
- **Courses**: Creation, retrieval, enrollment
- **Modules**: Creation, progression, content management
- **Quizzes**: Creation, submission, grading
- **User Progress**: Tracking, reporting
- **Admin Functions**: User management, system configuration

## Test Output

The test runner provides detailed reporting including:
- Number of tests passed/failed (48 total)
- Organized by feature area and category
- Clear indications of passing status

Example output:
```
Online Learning Progress Tracker - 48 Tests
  Authentication Features
    1. User Registration
      ✓ 1.1 should register a new student successfully
      ...
  48 passing (X seconds)
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - For API tests, ensure MongoDB is running
   - The simplified tests don't require a database connection

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - JWT secret might be misconfigured
   - Token expiration settings may need adjustment

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

## Notes on Test Environment

The simplified tests are designed to run in any environment without external dependencies. For the more comprehensive tests, a test database environment is recommended.
